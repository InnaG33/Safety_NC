#  Road Safety in North Carolina

For our project we wanted to find out about the safety of pedestrian and bicycle traffic in the North Carolina area. We searched the internet and found several robust datasets from the area. In fact, the datasets were so large that they took a long time to load on our computers so some cleaning and reformatting was required. We removed some of the columns that didnâ€™t contain relevant data to what we wanted to analyze using python and jupyter notebook. After doing that we picked some of the main datapoints we wanted to see visualized, such as crash severity and deaths. Included in the datasets were also the coordinates in latitude and longitude of all the reported crashes which allowed us to map the data in an interesting way using D3 and leaflet plugins, combined with JavaScript. Using a heat layer leaflet plugin it is easy to see the areas where the most crashes took place, which are around the most populous cities. Pedestrians had higher death numbers when hit by cars as compared to bicycles. MongoDB was used to help filter the data as well. We tried different JS D3 library leaflet plugins but some we had issues implementing so we went with the ones we could get to run smoothly with our data. An app was created to run our website and support the data.
